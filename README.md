# Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis

## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes Brazilian e-commerce data containing **100K+ orders from 2016 to 2018** across multiple marketplaces. The data provides a multi-dimensional view of online orders—from status, pricing, and payments to product details, customer reviews, and delivery performance.

The goal of the project is to extract insights from real transactional data to better understand customer behavior and performance metrics in the Brazilian e-commerce landscape.

### 🛠 ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

Raw data was extracted, cleaned, and transformed to ensure consistent formats and to remove irrelevant entries. The structured data was then loaded into a PostgreSQL database for efficient querying and analysis.

### 📈 RFM Analysis

Performed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling to segment customers based on purchasing behavior:

- **Recency** – How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency** – How often they purchase  
- **Monetary** – How much they spend  

This model helped identify loyal, at-risk, and high-value customers.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used EDA to:
- Identify customer and order trends  
- Highlight outliers or anomalies  
- Reveal relationships between payment, freight cost, product category, and delivery time  
- Uncover geographic and temporal patterns
